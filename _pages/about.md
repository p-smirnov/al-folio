Currently, I work as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory. I apply machine learning techniques to answer biological questions, and investigate how statistical methods adapt to biological data.

Previously, I completed my PhD in computational biology at the University of Toronto under the supervision of Benjamin Haibe-Kains and Trevor Pugh.
