  abstract = {Molecular subtyping is instrumental towards selection of model systems for fundamental research in tumor pathogenesis, and clinical patient assessment. Medulloblastoma (MB) is a highly heterogeneous, malignant brain tumor that is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths in children. Current MB classification schemes require large sample sizes, and standard reference samples, for subtype predictions. Such approaches are impractical in clinical settings with limited tumor biopsies, and unsuitable for model system predictions where standard reference samples are unavailable. Our developed Medullo-Model To Subtype (MM2S)  classifier stratifies single MB gene expression profiles without reference samples or replicates. Our pathway-centric approach facilitates subtype predictions of patient samples, and model systems including cell lines and mouse  models. MM2S demonstrates {$>$}96\% accuracy for patients of well-characterized normal cerebellum, WNT, or SHH subtypes, and the less-characterized Group 4 (86\%) and Group 3 (78.2\%). MM2S also enables classification of MB cell lines and mouse models into their human counterparts.},

  abstract = {Pharmacogenomics holds great promise for the development of biomarkers of drug response and the design of new therapeutic options, which are key challenges in precision medicine. However, such data are scattered and lack standards for efficient access and analysis, consequently preventing the realization of the full potential of pharmacogenomics. To address these issues, we implemented PharmacoGx, an easy-to-use, open source package for integrative analysis of multiple pharmacogenomic datasets. We demonstrate the utility of our package in comparing large drug sensitivity datasets, such as the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. Moreover, we show how to use our package to easily perform Connectivity Map analysis. With increasing availability of drug-related data, our package will open new avenues of research for meta-analysis of pharmacogenomic data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: PharmacoGx is implemented in R and can be easily installed on any system. The package is available from CRAN and its source code is available from GitHub.
